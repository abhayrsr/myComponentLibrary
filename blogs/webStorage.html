        <h1>What is Web Storage?</h1>
        <p class = "section-sub">Web storage also known as DOM storage, is one of the feature in HTML5. With web storage, the applications
            can store the data on the client site and can be manipulated accordingly. The data is mainly stored in key-value form where the 
            key is a string and the value can be of any data type like strings, numbers, objects converted to JSON strings.
         </p>

         <h2>Why web storage was introduced?</h2>
         <p class = "section-sub">Web storage was introduced as a part of HTML5 because there was some limitations in data storing mechanism
            like cookies(We'll discuss about this later in the blog).

            <li><span style="font-weight:bold">Storage Capacity:</span> Web storage provides developers an ease of storing more data on the client side as compared to
            cookies. It is easy to store data upto 4mb per domain with web storage.</li>
            <br/>
            <li><span style="font-weight:bold">Performance Enhancement:</span> Web storage is designed to be faster and efficient for data storage and retrieval compared
            to cookies.</li>
            <br/>
            <li><span style="font-weight:bold">Security:</span> Web storage is more secure than cookies. There are two strong reasons for that - first, with every HTTP request
            the data is not sent to the server automatically which limits the data exposure to any third party. Second, web storage follows the same 
            origin policy that means the data cannot be accessed from different origin or domain keeping the security intact.</li>
            <br/>
            Web storage provides two objects to store the data on browser:
            <br/>
            <span style="color:#38bdf8">window.localStorage</span>
            <br/>
            <span style="color:#38bdf8">window.sessionStorage</span>

         </p>

         <h2>Types of Web Storage</h2>
         <p class = "section-sub"> There are two types of web storage:
            <h3>1. Session Storage</h3>
            <p>It stores the data for one session that means when the browser tab is closed, the data in sessionStorage is cleared. In order to
                clear the sessionStorage object manually use <span style="color:#38bdf8">sessionStorage.clear()</span>.
            </p>
          
            <p>To store data in session storage, use <span style="color:#38bdf8">sessionStorage.setItem(key, value)</span> method in JavaScript.
            </p>    
            
            <p>To retrieve data, you can use <span style="color:#38bdf8">sessionStorage.getItem(key)</span>
            </p>
            <code>sessionStorage.setItem("name", "Peter");<br>
                const name = sessionStorage.getItem("name");<br>
                console.log(name);
            </code>
            <p><span style = "font-weight:bold">Output:</span> Peter</p>

            <h3>2. Local Storage</h3>
            <p>It stores the data locally within the browser. Even if you close the browser tab, the data will still remain unless you remove
                it manually using <span style="color:#38bdf8">localStorage.clear()</span>.
            </p>
            <p>To store data in session storage, use <span style="color:#38bdf8">localStorage.setItem(key, value)</span> method in JavaScript.
            </p>    
            
            <p>To retrieve data, you can use <span style="color:#38bdf8">localStorage.getItem(key)</span>
            </p>
            <code>localStorage.setItem("name", "Peter");<br>
                const name = localStorage.getItem("name");<br>
                console.log(name);
            </code>
            <p><span style = "font-weight:bold">Output:</span> Peter</p>

            <h2>Let's discuss a little bit about cookies</h2>
            <p>Cookies are the small piece of data sent by the web server to user's browser and is stored in user's device. With every request to 
                the server a cookie is sent back from the user's device.
            </p>

            <p>We know what are the limitations of using the cookies. But there are certain benefits attached to the usage of cookies some of which
                are listed below:
            </p>
            <li><span style = "font-weight:bold">Cross-Domain sharing:</span> Web storage is restricted to same-origin policy but in case of cross-domain sharing cookies are
            a nice fit configured to work across different domain, allowing cross-domain authentication and sharing of limited data.</li>
            <br/>
            <li><span style = "font-weight:bold">Compatibility:</span> Cookies are well supported by almost all web browsers which makes it quite 
            compatible to use.</li>

            <p>But still it is recommended to use Web storage over cookies because of its high storage capacity and enhanced security. No doubt, cookies
                have their place but it all depends on the requirement of your web application.
            </p>
         </p>
